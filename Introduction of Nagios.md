## Nagios Architecture:

Nagios follows a client-server architecture. Typically, a Nagios server is running on a host, and plugins are running on all remote hosts or clients that need to be monitored.

### How does it work?

- Configuration details are specified in configuration files.
- The daemon reads these details to determine what data should be collected.
- The daemon uses NRPE plug-ins to collect data from nodes and stores it in its local database.
- Finally, it presents all the collected data in a dashboard.
